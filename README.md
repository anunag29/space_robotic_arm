# Space Robotic Arm Control

This project focuses on developing a reinforcement learning agent for controlling a robotic arm in space environments, optimizing trajectory planning to achieve precise targets. The system is designed to handle both stationary and moving targets using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy algorithm.

## Features

- Reinforcement learning agent for robotic arm control.
- Optimizes trajectory planning for precise target reaching.
- Implementation of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy algorithm.
- Capable of handling both stationary and moving targets.
- Development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based SAC policy for optimizing trajectory planning directly from raw-image data.

## Usage
